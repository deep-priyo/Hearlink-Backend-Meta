**Ohm's Law Formula Wheel: Key Points**

* Ohm's Law formula: Voltage (V) = Current (I) x Resistance (R)
* The formula wheel helps calculate voltage, current, or resistance easily
* To use the wheel:
  * Cover the value you want to calculate and read the remaining formula
  * Current (I) = V/R
  * Resistance (R) = V/I
  * Voltage (V) = I x R

**Applying the Formula Wheel to Other Equations**

* The same concept can be applied to other formulas, such as Power (P) = V x I
* Using the Power formula wheel:
  * Voltage (V) = P/I
  * Current (I) = P/V
